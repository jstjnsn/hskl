I'm trying to do a Haskell.

## getting started

https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/#

## tutorial i'm following

https://learn-haskell.blog/

## commands

- Build binary: `ghc ./Html.hs`, followed by `./Html`
- Run code via interpreter: `ghci ./Html.hs`, followed by `main`
- Run code directly: `runghc ./Html.hs`
- Send code output to html: `runghc ./Html.hs > index.html`
- Open Html in a browser: `firefox index.html` or `open -a "Firefox" index.html`
